# War-on-Waste
<hr>
## Reduce Alpha line waste to 3 percent from 11 percent.
<br>
<p>Alpha line is a chocolate turtle mannufactering line, which feeds a two parallel flow wrappers and one handpack line. Relative to other plants lines, Alpha produces the most waste. Directed by senior management,  the War on Waste would decrease site waste below 3 percent; hence, this was a capstone project.
<br>
The Continious Imporvement team seeked to observe cost saving efforts, including caramel moisture comparison, caramel depositor setpoints, dichotomous nut sizes, dual spooler transition points, and flow wrapping settings.
<br>
### Caramel Equavilancey
The Kitchen is an isolated location on the second floor of the plant; the Kitchen, produces caramel for the Alpha line to deposit on a chocolate patty base. The quality techinicans observe caramel moisture, the current Key Performance Indicator (KPI), to characterize the caramel. Following the Kitchen production, the caramel flows to the depositor on the plant's base floor. The caramel is deposited at roughly 62Â°C, which is signifcatnly greater than the temperature in the Kitchen. Management, operatiors, and quality techincans believed the caramel moisture in the Kitchen and depositor were equivalent. The results exhibited there was extreme variations between the two locations and possibly machine deficines. The management staff pivoted to observe caramel viscosity to augment the KPI and added a project to predict the caramel viscosity given the Kitchen setpoints.
