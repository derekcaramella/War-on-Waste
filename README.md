# War on Waste
<hr>

## Reduce Alpha line waste to 3 percent from 11 percent.
<br>

Alpha line is a chocolate turtle manufacturing line, which feeds two parallel flow wrappers and one hand-pack line. Relative to other plants lines, Alpha produces the most waste. Directed by senior management, the War on Waste would decrease site waste below 3 percent; hence, this was a capstone project.

The Continuous Improvement team observed cost saving efforts, including caramel moisture comparison, caramel depositor setpoints, dichotomous nut sizes, dual spooler transition points, and flow wrapping settings.

### Caramel Equivalency
The Kitchen is an isolated location on the second floor of the plant; the Kitchen, produces caramel for the Alpha line to deposit on a chocolate patty base. The quality technicians observe caramel moisture, the current Key Performance Indicator (KPI), to characterize the caramel. Following the Kitchen production, the caramel flows to the depositor on the plant's base floor. The caramel is deposited at roughly 62°C, which is significantly greater than the temperature in the Kitchen. Management, operators, and quality technicians believed the caramel moisture in the Kitchen and depositor were equivalent. The results exhibited there was extreme variations between the two locations and possibly machine deficiencies. The management staff pivoted to observe caramel viscosity to augment the KPI and added a project to predict the caramel viscosity given the Kitchen setpoints.

### Caramel Depositor Setpoints
Identify scrap redound by utilizing depositing 6.25 grams of caramel relative to the standard 5.10 grams of caramel standard. Financially, caramel is less expensive that pecans; therefore, adjusting the turtle's component composition is advantageous to reduce direct costs. The management team pursued the Design of Experimentation to identify if it was plausible to reduce pecan contribution and utilize additional caramel. The results yielded inconsistent and larger turtle sizes.

### Dichotomous Nut Sizes
Alpha line is capable of producing Original, Bite, and Mini turtles. The management team began negotiating a new supply chain contract for pecans, it became apparent the current pecan size was too cumbersome for effective Bite production. The Research and Development Senior Manager suggested utilizing smaller pecans that would encourage turtle size consistency and decrease waste. However, many team members discarded the suggestions assuming the turtle volume [mm³] would decrease and the inconsistency is inherent. Following running multiple observations, the smaller pecans did not reduce overall turtle size and increased consistency. The project is ongoing to fortify the supply chain contract.

### Spooler Transitions
Following the chocolate base, nut depositor, and caramel depositor, the turtle travels through a cooling tunnel and over a wire mesh. In order to remove overapplied pecans, a spooler transition between the cooling tunnel and wire mesh permits unplaced pecans to fall through the spooler and prevent wire mesh clogging. While producing Original turtles, operations acknowledge significant waste when using the Original spooler. The management staff investigated the statistical difference between utilizing the Original spooler and the Bite spooler during Original turtle production. The results yielded statistically significant benefits utilizing the Bite spooler during Original turtle production.

### Flow Wrapping Settings
Manufacturing turtles is variable process, given the direct value-added materials: caramel, pecans, and chocolate. The turtle volume inconsistencies are apparent during the flow wrapping process because oversized turtles are rejected at a 3D Profile Station. The 3D Profile Station has subjective setpoints; therefore, operators may adjust the setpoints as they see fit. However, the operators should not significantly deviate from the centreline check sheet. The results yielded that operations are rejecting 100% oversized turtles and not attempting to package one over-sized turtle with two regular turtles. Thus, they are increasing waste, the recommendation includes relaxing the 3D Profile Station to admit slightly larger turtles assuming the likelihood that two regular turtles will fit within the same flow wrapper.
