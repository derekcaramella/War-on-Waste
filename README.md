# War-on-Waste
<hr>
## Reduce Alpha line waste to 3 percent from 11 percent.
<br>
<p>Alpha line is a chocolate turtle mannufactering line, which feeds a two parallel flow wrappers and one handpack line. Relative to other plants lines, Alpha produces the most waste. Directed by senior management,  the War on Waste would decrease site waste below 3 percent; hence, this was a capstone project.
<br>
The Continious Imporvement team seeked to observe cost saving efforts, including caramel moisture comparison, caramel depositor setpoints, dichotomous nut sizes, dual spooler transition points, and flow wrapping settings.
